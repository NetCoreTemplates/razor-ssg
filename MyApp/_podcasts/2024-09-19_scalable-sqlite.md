This episode covers the benefits and limitations of using SQLite as a database for web applications. 
It highlights its advantages, including performance, low cost, and flexibility, but also 
acknowledges its single concurrent writer limitation then proposes solutions to overcome this 
limitation through techniques like using separate databases, employing database locks, and queuing 
database writes with SyncCommand. 

It goes through real-world examples of open-source web applications built on SQLite, demonstrating 
its suitability for various use cases including an exciting upcoming project: AI Server, 
which aims to provide a free, OSS platform for managing and accessing various AI services, 
emphasizing its reliance on SQLite for its database needs.
