This episode looks at Razor SSG - a free, open-source project template for creating fast, 
static websites and blogs, now includes support for podcasts. 

This new feature leverages Markdown and C# Razor Pages, allowing users to easily 
add podcasts to their websites. Users can create and publish podcasts for free using 
GitHub Pages CDN and customize podcast content with Markdown and interactive Vue Components. 

Podcasts are playable through an integrated AudioPlayer component, and users can easily browse 
podcast archives by tags and year. The template also generates an iTunes-compatible 
RSS feed, making it simple to publish podcasts to Apple Podcasts.
