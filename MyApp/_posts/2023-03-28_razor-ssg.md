Razor SSG is a Razor Pages powered Markdown alternative to [Ruby's Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & 
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that's ideal for generating static websites & blogs using C#, Razor Pages & Markdown. 

For enhanced interactivity, static markdown content can be [progressively enhanced](/posts/javascript) with Vue 3 components,
as done in this example that embed's the 
[GettingStarted.mjs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/mjs/components/GettingStarted.mjs) 
Vue Component to create new Razor SSG App's below with:

```html
<div class="not-prose text-base" data-component="GettingStarted"></div>
```

<div class="not-prose text-base flex justify-center" data-component="GettingStarted"></div>

Although with full control over the websites `_Layout.cshtml`, you're free to use any preferred JS Module or Web Component you prefer.

### GitHub Codespaces friendly

In addition to having a pure Razor + .NET solution to create fast, CDN-hostable static websites, it also aims to provide a 
great experience from GitHub Codespaces, where you can create, test, check-in and have the included GitHub Actions deploy 
to GitHub Pages CDN from your iPad!

## Razor Pages

Your website can be built using either Markdown `.md` or Razor `.cshtml` pages, although it's generally recommended to 
use Markdown to capture the static content for your website for improved productivity and ease of maintenance.

### Content in Markdown, Functionality in Razor Pages

The basic premise behind most built-in features is to capture static content in markdown using a combination of 
folder structure & file name conventions in addition to each markdown page's frontmatter & content. This information
is then used to power each feature using Razor pages for precise layout and functionality.

The template includes the source code for each website feature, enabling full customization that also serves as good examples
for how to implement your own custom markdown-powered website features.

### Markdown Feature Structure

All markdown features are effectively implemented in the same way, starting with a **_folder** for maintaining its static markdown
content, a **.cs** class to load the markdown and a **.cshtml** Razor Page to render it: 

| Location | Description |
| - | - |
| `/_{Feature}` | Maintains the static markdown for the feature |
| `Markdown.{Feature}.cs` | Functionality to read the feature's markdown into logical collections |
| `{Feature}.cshtml` | Functionality to Render the feature |
| [Configure.Ssg.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Configure.Ssg.cs) | Initializes and registers the feature with ASP .NET's IOC |

Lets see what this looks like in practice by walking through the "Pages" feature: 

## Pages Feature

The pages feature simply makes all pages in the **_pages** folder, available from `/{filename}` where the included pages:

### [/_pages](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/tree/main/MyApp/_pages)
 - privacy.md
 - speaking.md
 - uses.md
 
Are made available from:

 - [/privacy](/privacy)
 - [/speaking](/speaking)
 - [/uses](/uses)

### Loading 

The code that loads the Pages feature markdown content is in [Markdown.Pages.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Markdown.Pages.cs):

```csharp
public class MarkdownPages : MarkdownPagesBase<MarkdownFileInfo>
{
    public MarkdownPages(ILogger<MarkdownPages> log, IWebHostEnvironment env) 
        : base(log,env) {}
    
    List<MarkdownFileInfo> Pages { get; set; } = new();
    public List<MarkdownFileInfo> VisiblePages => Pages.Where(IsVisible).ToList();

    public MarkdownFileInfo? GetBySlug(string slug) => 
        Fresh(VisiblePages.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Slug == slug));

    public void LoadFrom(string fromDirectory)
    {
        Pages.Clear();
        var fs = AssertVirtualFiles();
        var files = fs.GetDirectory(fromDirectory).GetAllFiles().ToList();
        var log = LogManager.GetLogger(GetType());
        log.InfoFormat("Found {0} pages", files.Count);

        var pipeline = CreatePipeline();

        foreach (var file in files)
        {
            var doc = Load(file.VirtualPath, pipeline);
            if (doc == null)
                continue;

            Pages.Add(doc);
        }
    }
}
```

Which ultimately just loads Markdown files using the configured [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) pipeline in its `Pages` 
collection which is made available via its `VisiblePages` property which returns all documents in development whilst hiding
**Draft** and content published at a **Future Date** from production builds.

### Rendering

The pages are then rendered in [Page.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Page.cshtml) Razor Page
that's available from `/{slug}`

```csharp
@page "/{slug}"
@model MyApp.Page
@inject MarkdownPages Markdown

@implements IRenderStatic<MyApp.Page>
@functions {
    public List<Page> GetStaticProps(RenderContext ctx)
    {
        var markdown = ctx.Resolve<MarkdownPages>();
        return markdown.VisiblePages.Map(page => new Page { Slug = page.Slug! });
    }
}

@{
    var doc = Markdown.GetBySlug(Model.Slug);
    if (doc.Layout != null) 
        Layout = doc.Layout == "none"
            ? null
            : doc.Layout;
    ViewData["Title"] = doc.Title;
}

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/typography.css">
<section class="flex-col md:flex-row flex justify-center mt-16 mb-16 md:mb-12">
    <h1 class="text-4xl tracking-tight font-extrabold text-gray-900">
        @doc.Title
    </h1>
</section>    
<div class="mx-auto">
    <div class="mx-auto prose lg:prose-xl mb-24">
        @Html.Raw(doc.Preview)
    </div>
</div>

@await Html.PartialAsync("HighlightIncludes")
<script>hljs.highlightAll()</script>
```

Which uses a custom layout if one is defined in its frontmatter which 
[speaking.md](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/_pages/speaking.md) utilizes in its **layout** frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Speaking
layout: _LayoutContent
---
```

To render the page using [_LayoutContent.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Shared/_LayoutContent.cshtml)
visible by the background backdrop in its [/speaking](/speaking) page.

## What's New Feature

The [/whatsnew](/whatsnew) page is an example of creating a custom Markdown feature to implement a portfolio or a product releases page
where a new folder is created per release, containing both release date and release or project name, with all features in that release 
maintained markdown content sorted in alphabetical order:

### [/_whatsnew](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/tree/main/MyApp/_whatsnew)

- **/2023-03-08_Animaginary**
  - feature1.md 
- **/2023-03-18_OpenShuttle**
   - feature1.md
- **/2023-03-28_Planetaria**
   - feature1.md 

What's New follows the same structure as Pages feature which is loaded in:

 - [Markdown.WhatsNew.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Markdown.WhatsNew.cs)

and rendered in:
- [WhatsNew.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/WhatsNew.cshtml)

## Blog Feature

The blog maintains its markdown posts in a flat folder which each Markdown post containing its publish date and URL slug it 
should be published under:

### [/_posts](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/tree/main/MyApp/_posts)

 - ...
 - 2023-01-21_start.md
 - 2023-03-21_javascript.md
 - 2023-03-28_razor-ssg.md

As the Blog has more features it requires a larger [Markdown.Blog.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Markdown.Blog.cs)
to load its Markdown posts that is rendered in several different Razor Pages for each of its Views:

| Page | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| [Blog.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Blog.cshtml) | Main Blog layout | [/blog](/blog) | 
| [Posts/Index.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Index.cshtml) | Navigable Archive grid of Posts | [/posts](/posts) | 
| [Posts/Post.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Post.cshtml) | Individual Blog Post (like this!) | [/posts/razor-ssg](/posts/razor-ssg) |
| [Author.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Author.cshtml) | Display Posts by Author | [/posts/author/lucy-bates](/posts/author/lucy-bates) | 
| [Tagged.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Tagged.cshtml) | Display Posts by Tag | [/posts/tagged/markdown](/posts/tagged/markdown) |
| [Year.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Year.cshtml) | Display Posts by Year | [/posts/year/2023](/posts/year/2023) |

### General Features

Most unique markdown features are captured in their Markdown's frontmatter metadata, but in general these features
are broadly available for all features:

 - **Live Reload** - Latest Markdown content is displayed during **Development** 
 - **Custom Layouts** - Render post in custom Razor Layout with `layout: _LayoutAlt`
 - **Drafts** - Prevent posts being worked on from being published with `draft: true`
 - **Future Dates** - Posts with a future date wont be published until that date

### Initializing and Loading Markdown Features

All markdown features are initialized in the same way in [Configure.Ssg.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Configure.Ssg.cs)
where they're registered in ASP.NET Core's IOC and initialized after the App's plugins are loaded
by injecting with the App's [Virtual Files provider](https://docs.servicestack.net/virtual-file-system)
before using it to read from the directory where the markdown content for each feature is maintained: 

```csharp
public class ConfigureSsg : IHostingStartup
{
    public void Configure(IWebHostBuilder builder) => builder
        .ConfigureServices(services =>
        {
            services.AddSingleton<RazorPagesEngine>();
            services.AddSingleton<MarkdownPages>();
            services.AddSingleton<MarkdownWhatsNew>();
            services.AddSingleton<MarkdownBlog>();
        })
        .ConfigureAppHost(afterPluginsLoaded: appHost => {
            var pages = appHost.Resolve<MarkdownPages>();
            var whatsNew = appHost.Resolve<MarkdownWhatsNew>();
            var blogPosts = appHost.Resolve<MarkdownBlog>();
            
            var features = new IMarkdownPages[] { pages, whatsNew, blogPosts }; 
            features.Each(x => x.VirtualFiles = appHost.VirtualFiles);

            // Custom initialization
            blogPosts.Authors = Authors;

            // Load feature markdown content
            pages.LoadFrom("_pages");
            whatsNew.LoadFrom("_whatsnew");
            blogPosts.LoadFrom("_posts");
        });
    });
    //...
}
```

These dependencies are then injected in the feature's Razor Pages to query and render the loaded markdown content.

### Custom Frontmatter

You can extend the `MarkdownFileInfo` type used to maintain the markdown content and metadata of each loaded Markdown file
by adding any additional metadata you want included as C# properties on:

```csharp
// Add additional frontmatter info to include
public class MarkdownFileInfo : MarkdownFileBase
{
}
```

Any additional properties are automatically populated using ServiceStack's 
[built-in Automapping](https://docs.servicestack.net/auto-mapping) which includes rich support for converting string frontmatter 
values into native .NET types.

### Updating to latest versions

You can easily update all the JavaScript dependencies used in 
[postinstall.js](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/postinstall.js) by running:

<div class="not-prose text-base" data-component="ShellCommand" data-props="{ text: 'node postinstall.js' }"></div>

This will also update the Markdown features `*.cs` implementations which is delivered as source files instead of an external
NuGet package to enable full customization, easier debugging whilst supporting easy upgrades. 

If you do customize any of the `.cs` files, you'll want to exclude them from being updated by removing them from:

```js
const hostFiles = [
    'Markdown.Blog.cs',
    'Markdown.Pages.cs',
    'Markdown.WhatsNew.cs',
    'MarkdownPagesBase.cs',
]
```

### Markdown Tag Helper

The included [MarkdownTagHelper.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/MarkdownTagHelper.cs) can be used
in hybrid Razor Pages like [About.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/About.cshtml) 
to render the [/about](/about) page which requires the flexibility of Razor Pages with a static content component which you 
prefer to maintain inline with Markdown.

The `<markdown />` tag helper renders plain HTML, which you can apply [Tailwind's @typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) 
styles by including **typography.css** and annotating it with your preferred `prose` variant, e.g:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/typography.css">
<markdown class="prose">
  Markdown content...
</markdown>
```

## Static Static Generation (SSG)

All features up till now describes how this template implements a Markdown powered Razor Pages .NET application, where this template
differs in its published output, where instead of a .NET App deployed to a VM or App server it generates static `*.html` files that's
bundled together with `/wwwroot` static assets in the `/dist` folder that can be previewed by launching a HTTP Server from that
folder with the built-in npm script:

<div class="not-prose text-base" data-component="ShellCommand" data-props="{ text: 'npm run serve' }"></div>

To run **npx http-server** on `http://localhost:8080` that you can open in a browser to preview the published version of your 
site as it would be when hosted on a CDN.

### Static Razor Pages

The static generation functionality works by scanning all your Razor Pages and prerendering the pages with prerendering instructions.

### Pages with Static Routes

Pages with static routes can be marked to be prerendered by annotating it with the `[RenderStatic]` attribute as done in
[About.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/About.cshtml):

```csharp
@page "/about"
@attribute [RenderStatic]
```

Which saves the pre-rendered page using the pages route with a .html suffix, e.g: `/{@page route}.html` whilst pages with static
routes with a trailing `/` are saved to `/{@page route}/index.html` as done for 
[Posts/Index.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Index.cshtml):

```csharp
@page "/posts/"
@attribute [RenderStatic]
```

#### Explicit generated paths

To keep the generated pages in-sync with using the same routes as your Razor Pages in development it's recommended to use the implied
rendered paths, but if preferred you can specify which path the page should be rendered to instead with:

```csharp
@page "/posts/"
@attribute [RenderStatic("/posts/index.html")]
```

### Pages with Dynamic Routes

Prerendering dynamic pages follows [Next.js getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) 
convention which you can implement using `IRenderStatic<PageModel>` by returning a Page Model for each page that should be generated
as done in [Posts/Post.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Post.cshtml) and
[Page.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Page.cshtml):

```csharp
@page "/{slug}"
@model MyApp.Page

@implements IRenderStatic<MyApp.Page>
@functions {
    public List<Page> GetStaticProps(RenderContext ctx)
    {
        var markdown = ctx.Resolve<MarkdownPages>();
        return markdown.VisiblePages.Map(page => new Page { Slug = page.Slug! });
    }
}
...
```

In this case it returns a Page Model for every **Visible** markdown page in 
[/_pages](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/tree/main/MyApp/_pages) that ends up rendering the following pages in `/dist`:

 - `/privacy.html`
 - `/speaking.html`
 - `/uses.html`

### Limitations

The primary limitations for developing statically generated Apps is that a **snapshot** of entire App is generated at deployment, 
which prohibits being able to render different content **per request**, e.g. for Authenticated users which would require executing
custom JavaScript after the page loads to dynamically alter the page's initial content.

Otherwise in practice you'll be able develop your Razor Pages utilizing Razor's full feature-set, the primary concessions stem
from Pages being executed in a static context which prohibits pages from returning dynamic content per request, instead any
"different views" should be maintained in separate pages.

#### No QueryString Params

As the generated pages should adopt the same routes as your Razor Pages you'll need to avoid relying on **?QueryString** params
and instead capture all required parameters for a page in its **@page route** as done for:

[Posts/Author.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Author.cshtml)

```csharp
@page "/posts/author/{slug}"
@model AuthorModel
@inject MarkdownBlog Blog

@implements IRenderStatic<AuthorModel>
@functions {
    public List<AuthorModel> GetStaticProps(RenderContext ctx) => ctx.Resolve<MarkdownBlog>()
        .AuthorSlugMap.Keys.Map(x => new AuthorModel { Slug = x });
}
...
```

Which lists all posts by an Author, e.g: [/posts/author/lucy-bates](/posts/author/lucy-bates), likewise required for:

[Posts/Tagged.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Tagged.cshtml)

```csharp
@page "/posts/tagged/{slug}"
@model TaggedModel
@inject MarkdownBlog Blog

@implements IRenderStatic<TaggedModel>
@functions {
    public List<TaggedModel> GetStaticProps(RenderContext ctx) => ctx.Resolve<MarkdownBlog>()
        .TagSlugMap.Keys.Map(x => new TaggedModel { Slug = x });
}
...
```

Which lists all related posts with a specific tag, e.g: [/posts/tagged/markdown](/posts/tagged/markdown), and for:

[Posts/Year.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Year.cshtml)

```csharp
@page "/posts/year/{year}"
@model YearModel
@inject MarkdownBlog Blog

@implements IRenderStatic<YearModel>
@functions {
    public List<YearModel> GetStaticProps(RenderContext ctx) => ctx.Resolve<MarkdownBlog>()
        .VisiblePosts.Select(x => x.Date.GetValueOrDefault().Year)
            .Distinct().Map(x => new YearModel { Year = x });
}

...
```

Which lists all posts published in a specific year, e.g: [/posts/year/2023](/posts/year/2023).

Conceivably these "different views" could've been implemented by the same page with different `?author`, `?tag` and `?year`
QueryString params, but are instead extracted into different pages to support its statically generated `*.html` outputs.
