Razor SSG is a Razor Pages powered Markdown alternative to [Ruby's Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & 
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) that's ideal for generating static websites & blogs using C#, Razor Pages & Markdown. 

For enhanced interactivity, static markdown content can be [progressively enhanced](/posts/javascript) with Vue 3 components,
as done in this example that embed's the 
[GettingStarted.mjs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/wwwroot/mjs/components/GettingStarted.mjs) 
Vue Component to create new Razor SSG App's below with:

```html
<div class="not-prose text-base" data-component="GettingStarted"></div>
```

<div class="not-prose text-base flex justify-center" data-component="GettingStarted"></div>

Although with full control over the websites `_Layout.cshtml`, you're free to use any preferred JS Module or Web Component you wish.

### GitHub Codespaces friendly

In addition to having a pure Razor + .NET solution to create fast, CDN-hostable static websites, it also aims to be able
to provide a good experience from GitHub Codespaces, where you'll be able to create, test, check-in and have the included GitHub
Actions deploy to GitHub Pages CDN from your iPad!


## Razor Pages

Your website can be built using either Markdown `.md` or Razor `.cshtml` pages, although it's generally recommended to 
use Markdown to capture the static content for your website for improved productivity and ease of maintenance.

### Content in Markdown, Functionality in Razor Pages

The basic premise behind most built-in features is to capture static content in markdown using a combination of 
folder structure & file name conventions in addition to each markdown page's frontmatter & content. This information
is then used to power each feature using Razor pages for precise layout and functionality.

The template includes the source code for each website feature, enabling full customization that also serves as good examples
for how to implement your own custom markdown-powered website features.

### Markdown Feature Structure

All markdown features are effectively implemented in the same way, starting with a **_folder** for maintaining its static markdown
content, a **.cs** class to load the markdown and a **.cshtml** Razor Page to render it: 

| Location | Description |
| - | - |
| `/_{Feature}` | Maintains the static markdown for the feature |
| `Markdown.{Feature}.cs` | Functionality to read the feature's markdown into logical collections |
| `{Feature}.cshtml` | Functionality to Render the feature |
| [Configure.Ssg.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Configure.Ssg.cs) | Initializes and registers the feature with ASP .NET's IOC |

Lets see what this looks like in practice by walking through the "Pages" feature: 

## Pages Feature

The pages feature simply makes all pages in the **_pages** folder, available from `/{filename}` where the included pages:

### [/_pages](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/tree/main/MyApp/_pages)
 - privacy.md
 - speaking.md
 - uses.md
 
Are made available from:

 - [/privacy](/privacy)
 - [/speaking](/speaking)
 - [/uses](/uses)

### Loading 

The code that loads the Pages feature markdown content is in [Markdown.Pages.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Markdown.Pages.cs):

```csharp
public class MarkdownPages : MarkdownPagesBase<MarkdownFileInfo>
{
    public MarkdownPages(ILogger<MarkdownPages> log, IWebHostEnvironment env) 
        : base(log,env) {}
    
    List<MarkdownFileInfo> Pages { get; set; } = new();
    public List<MarkdownFileInfo> VisiblePages => Pages.Where(IsVisible).ToList();

    public MarkdownFileInfo? GetBySlug(string slug) => 
        Fresh(VisiblePages.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Slug == slug));

    public void LoadFrom(string fromDirectory)
    {
        Pages.Clear();
        var fs = AssertVirtualFiles();
        var files = fs.GetDirectory(fromDirectory).GetAllFiles().ToList();
        var log = LogManager.GetLogger(GetType());
        log.InfoFormat("Found {0} pages", files.Count);

        var pipeline = CreatePipeline();

        foreach (var file in files)
        {
            var doc = Load(file.VirtualPath, pipeline);
            if (doc == null)
                continue;

            Pages.Add(doc);
        }
    }
}
```

Which ultimately just loads Markdown files using the configured [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) pipeline in its `Pages` 
collection which is made available via its `VisiblePages` property which returns all documents in development whilst hiding
**Draft** and content published at a **Future Date** from production builds.

### Rendering

The pages are then rendered in [Page.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Page.cshtml) Razor Page
that's available from `/{slug}`

```csharp
@page "/{slug}"
@model MyApp.Page
@inject MarkdownPages Markdown

@implements IRenderStatic<MyApp.Page>
@functions {
    public List<Page> GetStaticProps(RenderContext ctx)
    {
        var markdown = ctx.Resolve<MarkdownPages>();
        return markdown.VisiblePages.Map(page => new Page { Slug = page.Slug! });
    }
}

@{
    var doc = Markdown.GetBySlug(Model.Slug);
    if (doc.Layout != null) 
        Layout = doc.Layout == "none"
            ? null
            : doc.Layout;
    ViewData["Title"] = doc.Title;
}

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/typography.css">
<section class="flex-col md:flex-row flex justify-center mt-16 mb-16 md:mb-12">
    <h1 class="text-4xl tracking-tight font-extrabold text-gray-900">
        @doc.Title
    </h1>
</section>    
<div class="mx-auto">
    <div class="mx-auto prose lg:prose-xl mb-24">
        @Html.Raw(doc.Preview)
    </div>
</div>

@await Html.PartialAsync("HighlightIncludes")
<script>hljs.highlightAll()</script>
```

Which uses a custom layout if one is defined in its frontmatter which 
[speaking.md](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/_pages/speaking.md) utilizes in its **layout** frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Speaking
layout: _LayoutContent
---
```

To render the page using [_LayoutContent.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Shared/_LayoutContent.cshtml)
visible by the background backdrop in its [/speaking](/speaking) page.

## What's New Feature

The [/whatsnew](/whatsnew) page is an example of creating a custom Markdown feature to implement a portfolio or a product releases page
where a new folder is created per release, containing both release date and release or project name, with all features in that release 
maintained markdown content sorted in alphabetical order:

### [/_whatsnew](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/tree/main/MyApp/_whatsnew)

- **/2023-03-08_Animaginary**
  - feature1.md 
- **/2023-03-18_OpenShuttle**
   - feature1.md
- **/2023-03-28_Planetaria**
   - feature1.md 

What's New follows the same structure as Pages feature which is loaded in:

 - [Markdown.WhatsNew.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Markdown.WhatsNew.cs)

and rendered in:
- [WhatsNew.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/WhatsNew.cshtml)

## Blog Feature

The blog maintains its markdown posts in a flat folder which each Markdown post containing its publish date and URL slug it 
should be published under:

### [/_posts](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/tree/main/MyApp/_posts)

 - ...
 - 2023-01-21_start.md
 - 2023-03-21_javascript.md
 - 2023-03-28_razor-ssg.md

As the Blog has more features it requires a larger [Markdown.Blog.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Markdown.Blog.cs)
to load its Markdown posts that is rendered in several different Razor Pages for each of its Views:

| Page | Description | Example |
| - | - | - |
| [Blog.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Blog.cshtml) | Main Blog layout | [/blog](/blog) | 
| [Posts/Index.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Index.cshtml) | Navigable Archive grid of Posts | [/posts](/posts) | 
| [Posts/Post.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Post.cshtml) | Individual Blog Post (like this!) | [/posts/razor-ssg](/posts/razor-ssg) |
| [Author.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Author.cshtml) | Display Posts by Author | [/posts/author/lucy-bates](/posts/author/lucy-bates) | 
| [Tagged.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Tagged.cshtml) | Display Posts by Tag | [/posts/tagged/markdown](/posts/tagged/markdown) |
| [Year.cshtml](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/razor-ssg/blob/main/MyApp/Pages/Posts/Year.cshtml) | Display Posts by Year | [/posts/year/2023](/posts/year/2023) |

### General Features

Most unique markdown features are available in their Markdown's frontmatter metadata, whilst these general features
are available for each Markdown feature:

 - **Live Reload** - Each Markdown feature shows latest content during **Development** 
 - **Custom Layouts** - Render post in custom Razor Layout with `layout: _LayoutAlt`
 - **Drafts** - Prevent posts being worked on from being published with `draft: true`
 - **Future Dates** - Posts with a future date wont be published until that date
