The new ES6 classes provide a productive type-safe development model during development but can also be referenced as-is in JS Module scripts and run natively in browsers to enable instant typed API integrations without any build tools!

To achieve this the ES6 classes are annotated with JSDoc type hints in comments which enjoys broad support in IDEs and tools like TypeScript where it can be used to provide type information in JavaScript files.

They're now a first-class Add ServiceStack Reference language supported language complete with IDE integration in the latest ServiceStack Plugins for VS .NET and JetBrains IDEs.
