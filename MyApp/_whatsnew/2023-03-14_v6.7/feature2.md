The new AutoQueryGrid component is the last high-productivity component missing from the Vue Tailwind Component Library to reach feature parity with Blazor Tailwind Component Library.

It enables an Effortless CRUD UI without any external dependencies, tooling or build steps, generating a capability-based UI for the currently authenticated user, enabling full CRUD functionality through the App's auth-protected AutoQuery APIs, validated by the APIs Declarative Validation Rules utilizing optimal Form Inputs for each C# property type with contextual validation binding, that displays its results in a rich formatted data grid customized with APIs Declarative UI Attributes.
