With access to all components needed, we've taken this opportunity to modernize all of ServiceStack's built-in UI's that were previously written with petite-vue and have rewritten them with Vue 3 and the Vue Components Library, which has become our preferred UI technology stack for all of ServiceStack's built-in UIs.

Ultimately the new Vue 3 UIs should appeal to a lot more use-cases with better reuse and customizability using the full Vue 3 framework and 3rd Party ecosystem for creating more compelling and interactive UIs.
