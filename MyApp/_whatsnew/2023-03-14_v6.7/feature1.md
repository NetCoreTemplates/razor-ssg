The new Auto HTML Page is the best way to visualize, inspect and integrate with your APIs which provides instant utility for API consumers in consuming your APIs with a built-in API Response Visualizer, JSON syntax highlighting, integrated Postman-like UI and API SDK integration all-in-one.

A nice benefit of ServiceStack's API Design is that consuming APIs are fundamentally all done the same way in all languages, which just requires adding a dependency containing a generic ServiceClient which can be used to call any ServiceStack API using the typed DTOs copied directly from the API docs page to enable an end-to-end typed API without any external tooling or build steps.
